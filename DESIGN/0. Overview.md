# The Design of Dance Dance Revolution Studio
This series of documents is meant to cover in depth the design choices - that is, the programming language choice, data
structure design, function design, etc., that go into designing this program.  

That way, not only will others be able to understand what I am doing, and what I am trying to do, but I will be able to 
keep my ADHD-ass on task with regards to developing this software in a logical manner that doesn't overwhelm me to no end.
