# The Design of Dance Dance Revolution Studio
This series of documents is meant to cover in depth the design choices - that is, the programming language choice, data structure design, function design, etc., that go into designing this program.  

That way, not only will others be able to understand what I am doing, and what I am trying to do, but I will be able to 
keep my ADHD-ass on task with regards to developing this software in a logical manner that doesn't overwhelm me to no end.

# Programming Language Choice
For this program, I decided to go with C.  This choice was due to a combination of speed, and control over the design of various data structures, since this suite will be doing a lot of processing of binary and text data.  This includes the ability to do various tricks with raw pointers that I cannot do in other languages such as Java and C# (much as I absolutely love C#).
